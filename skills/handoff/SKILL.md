# yishuship: Handoff

Commit the related changes, push the branch, create or update the PR,
then keep looping until GitHub checks are fully green and the PR is
merge-ready.

Read `../.shared/matt-pocock-standard.md` and
`../../vendor/mattpocock-skills/skills/productivity/handoff/SKILL.md` before
handoff. yishuship handoff is release delivery, not only context compaction,
but it inherits Matt's handoff rule: do not duplicate artifacts already captured
elsewhere; reference PRDs, plans, ADRs, diffs, and verification evidence by path
or URL.

If merge, rebase, or conflict resolution enters the handoff loop, also read
`../../vendor/mattpocock-skills/skills/engineering/resolving-merge-conflicts/SKILL.md`.

Do not stop when the PR is created.
Do not stop while any GitHub check is pending.
If any GitHub check fails, fix the problem, push again, and wait again.
If the PR is not merge-ready, sync with base or resolve conflicts inside
the same fix loop.

Escalate to the user only for judgment decisions or after retry limits
are exhausted.

Done means every condition in [Completion](#completion) is satisfied:
the PR exists, checks are green with no relevant pending contexts, the PR
is merge-ready with no unresolved conflicts or required branch update, and
no actionable review or bot feedback remains.

(Full termination + escalation criteria in "Completion" at the bottom.)

## Process Flow

Run this loop:

1. Pre-flight: resolve the branch, task context, and related changes to ship.
2. Run the relevant local verification.
3. Update any required changelog or directly affected docs.
4. Commit the related changes.
5. Push the branch.
6. Create or update the PR.
7. Inspect `.github/workflows` and current PR checks so you know what this repo treats as CI/CD.
8. Wait until GitHub checks finish.
9. If any relevant check is still pending, keep waiting.
10. If any relevant check fails, or an AI review workflow leaves actionable comments, fix the problem, verify the fix, commit, push, and wait again.
11. If the branch must be updated from base to clear drift, conflicts, or repo policy, sync with base inside the fix loop, then verify, commit, push, and wait again.
12. If the PR is not merge-ready, fix the cause inside the same loop.
13. Ignore `cancelled` checks unless they block the repo's normal CI/CD path.
14. Stop after 3 fix rounds and escalate to the user.

## Red Flag

**Never:**
- **Stop when the PR is created** — #1 failure mode
- Push code changes without re-running relevant local verification
- Force push without `--force-with-lease`
- Rewrite an already-pushed PR branch when there are human review,
  approval, or shared-branch signals
- Treat `pending` checks as "good enough"
- Treat green checks as sufficient when `mergeStateStatus` is still blocked
- Create the PR before local verification runs
- Use `git add -A` when unrelated local changes are present
- Forget to stage and commit changelog or doc edits before the first push
- Mark a thread or comment as resolved before the fix is actually pushed
- Resolve comments that still need product, security, or architecture judgment
- Fix failures without reading the actual check logs or review comments
- Sync with base preemptively — only when drift, conflicts, or repo policy require it
- Loop past 3 fix rounds — escalate instead
- Leave doc debt implicit — carry it into the PR

---

## Progress Tracking

Use `TodoWrite` to track your own progress through the handoff phases.
Create todos at the start based on what the repo actually needs.
Not every repo has a CHANGELOG, CI, or docs to update — only include
items for work that will actually happen.

**Principle**: one todo per phase the user would wait on. Fix rounds
are dynamic — add them only when a check fails.

**Example** (repo with CHANGELOG and CI):

```
TodoWrite([
  { content: "Pre-flight (resolve branch and scope)", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Resolving branch and scope" },
  { content: "Run local verification",                status: "pending",     activeForm: "Running local verification" },
  { content: "Update CHANGELOG and docs",             status: "pending",     activeForm: "Updating CHANGELOG and docs" },
  { content: "Push and create PR",                    status: "pending",     activeForm: "Pushing and creating PR" },
  { content: "Wait for GitHub checks",                status: "pending",     activeForm: "Watching PR checks" }
])
```

**Adaptations** (not exhaustive — use judgment):
- No CHANGELOG.md and no doc changes needed → drop that item entirely
- No CI workflows and no PR check contexts after PR creation → drop
  "Wait for GitHub checks"
- Check fails → insert `"Fix round N/3 — <issue summary>"` with `in_progress`
- PR already exists (update flow) → rename "Push and create PR" to
  "Push update to existing PR"

---

## Phase 1: Pre-flight

Resolve only the context needed to ship the PR:

1. Determine the current branch.
   - If HEAD is detached, create a feature branch before continuing.
2. Determine the base branch:
   - use the existing PR base if a PR already exists
   - otherwise use the repo default branch
3. If the current branch is the base branch, create a feature branch before continuing.
4. Inspect the current scope with `git status --short`, `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat`, `git diff --cached --stat`, and `git diff --stat`.
5. Decide which local changes belong to this handoff.
6. Do not use `git add -A` unless every dirty file belongs to this handoff.
7. If unrelated local changes cannot be separated safely, stop and escalate instead of guessing.
8. If the caller already provides `task_dir`, use it. Otherwise do not guess one here; resolve it only if a later phase needs to write artifacts.

Output a short start summary with the branch, base branch, and scope being shipped.

## Phase 2: Verify Before PR

Before the first push in handoff, run the most relevant local verification
available for this repo.

- Prefer the same commands the repo or CI already uses.
- Run only the checks that are relevant to the changed area: tests, lint,
  typecheck, build, or targeted smoke checks as applicable.
- If code changes during handoff, run the relevant verification again before
  the next push.
- If a task directory already exists, do not invent extra artifacts just for handoff.
- If verification fails, fix the issue before pushing.

Output a short summary of what was run and whether it passed.

## Phase 3: Update CHANGELOG and Docs

### Step A: CHANGELOG (auto-generate)

`[ -f CHANGELOG.md ] || echo 'NO_CHANGELOG'`
- No CHANGELOG.md → skip silently.

If CHANGELOG.md exists:
1. Read header to learn the format
2. Generate entry from: `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`
3. Categorize: Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed
4. Insert after header, dated today
5. Commit: `git add CHANGELOG.md && git commit -m "docs: update CHANGELOG"`

After changelog handling, check whether the shipped changes also changed any
user-facing or repo-facing documentation truths before the first push.

Use `references/documentation.md` for the documentation decision tree and
ownership rules.

- Only inspect docs that directly describe the changed commands, config,
  file paths, workflow, or behavior.
- Do not scan every markdown file in the repo.
- Route each changed truth to the narrowest correct document instead of
  defaulting to top-level docs.
- If a doc is mechanically stale, fix it in the same handoff loop.
- If the doc issue is semantic and you are not confident about the right
  wording, carry that note into the PR instead of inventing an explanation.
- Before moving on, explicitly record one of:
  - docs updated
  - docs checked, no update needed
  - doc debt to note in the PR

## Phase 4: Push and Create PR

When opening or updating the PR, keep the title and body concise.

Include only:
- what changed
- what local verification ran
- any known follow-up, risk, or skipped check

Do not invent a long template if the change is simple.

Push and create:
1. Review the final diff, then stage all related changes that should ship now, including any changelog or doc edits made in this handoff.
2. Commit the staged changes if anything new was staged in this phase.
3. `git push -u origin HEAD`
4. Create the PR if it does not exist.
5. If the PR already exists, update the body or add a short comment with the latest verification summary.
6. If `task_dir` exists, write or update `<task_dir>/handoff.md` with:
   PR URL, branch, base, verification commands/results, docs outcome,
   current check summary, current `mergeStateStatus`, and fix-round count.
   This file is the handoff evidence consumed by the stop gate.

Output: `[Handoff] PR created: <url>`

## Phase 5: Wait for GitHub Checks

Inspect `.github/workflows`, branch protection signals, and the current PR
checks once so you understand what this repo expects to run. A repo can
have required checks from GitHub Apps even when it has no local workflow
files, so never skip this phase based on `.github/workflows` alone.

**Arm a Monitor, don't poll.** `gh pr checks --watch` blocks locally and
polls GitHub itself every ~10s — you stay idle until checks terminate. This
replaces the older 30-second agent-side poll loop (which burned ~20
round-trips per 10-minute CI wait) with a single arm + single handle cycle.

Before arming, check whether a Monitor for this PR is already running — on
resume after escalation the prior watch may still be alive. If so, wait for
its event; do not arm a duplicate.

Arm the watch with `persistent: true` so it survives across fix rounds:

    Monitor(
      command: 'gh pr checks --watch; echo "TERMINAL exit=$?"',
      description: "PR <number> checks settling",
      persistent: true,
      timeout_ms: 3600000
    )

When a `TERMINAL exit=<code>` event arrives, pull the authoritative state
once:

```bash
# Full snapshot for interpretation
gh pr view --json state,statusCheckRollup,reviews,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,comments

# Machine-readable check summary
gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link,workflow

# Read failing check logs if any. Prefer the failed run URL/check URL from
# the snapshot; use gh run view only after identifying the run id.
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Also inspect unresolved review threads when review comments may be
actionable. `gh pr view --json comments,reviews` is not enough because it
does not reliably expose thread resolution state.

```bash
OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner --jq '.owner.login')
REPO=$(gh repo view --json name --jq '.name')
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
gh api graphql -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F number="$PR_NUMBER" -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 20) {
            nodes {
              id
              author { login }
              body
              path
              line
              outdated
              url
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Interpret the snapshot:

- All relevant checks `SUCCESS`, `NEUTRAL`, or intentionally ignored
  optional `SKIPPED`/`CANCELLED` → check gate green
- Any relevant `FAILURE`, `ERROR`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`, or failed check
  bucket → Phase 6 fix loop
- Any relevant pending, queued, in-progress, expected, or waiting check
  → keep waiting
- `mergeStateStatus` is `DIRTY`, `BEHIND`, `BLOCKED`, `DRAFT`, or
  `UNKNOWN` after one re-query → Phase 6 fix loop or escalation
- `mergeable` is `CONFLICTING` → Phase 6 fix loop
- Any actionable unresolved review thread, review comment, or bot/workflow
  comment → Phase 6 fix loop
- `CANCELLED` checks → informational only when they are optional and do
  not block normal CI/CD
- Exit code non-zero but no concrete failure found in snapshot → re-query
  once, then escalate as ambiguous CI state

**Fallback.** If no `TERMINAL` event fires within the 1h timeout, TaskStop
the monitor and escalate as an external GitHub wait — not a code fix
failure. Record which checks were still pending at escalation time so the
user can investigate on GitHub.

**Re-entering the fix loop.** When Phase 6 finishes pushing a fix, re-arm
the Monitor (the previous one exited on the prior terminal event) and loop
back to the event-wait above.

## Phase 6: Fix Loop

If CI failures, review comments, or merge conflicts exist, fix them.
Max 3 rounds — after that, escalate.

In each fix round:

1. Re-read the current PR status on GitHub, including checks,
   `mergeStateStatus`, and unresolved review threads.
2. If checks failed, inspect the failing check logs and fix the smallest
   real cause.
3. If review comments are actionable, fix mechanical or correctness issues.
4. If a comment requires product, security, or architecture judgment,
   escalate instead of guessing.
5. If `mergeStateStatus` reports conflicts, base drift, branch protection
   blockage, or a repo policy requires an update from base, sync with base
   and resolve it carefully.
   Use this strategy:
   - Always start with `git fetch origin <base-branch>`.
   - Prefer `git rebase origin/<base-branch>` when it can preserve a
     clean linear history without disrupting collaborators. This is
     always appropriate before the branch is pushed.
   - For an already-pushed PR branch, choose rebase only when all of
     these safety gates pass: the branch is agent-owned, there are no
     human approvals or unresolved human review threads, no other author
     has pushed commits to the branch, and the repo appears to expect
     linear history. Push the result with `git push --force-with-lease`,
     never plain `--force`.
   - If any safety gate fails, prefer `git merge --no-ff
     origin/<base-branch>` (or the repo's equivalent update-branch
     operation) so the fix can be pushed without rewriting review
     history.
   - If repo policy requires linear history but the rebase safety gates
     do not pass, escalate for user approval.

   For an already-pushed PR branch, read
   `references/rebase-safety.md` and prove every gate before rebasing.
6. Do not resolve conflicts mechanically with `--ours` or `--theirs` unless
   one side is clearly disposable.
7. Read both sides of the conflict and preserve the behavior this PR is
   trying to ship. If both sides contain valid changes, merge them.
8. If you cannot resolve the conflict confidently, escalate instead of guessing.
9. After any code change, run the relevant local verification again.
10. Commit the fix and push it.
11. Update `<task_dir>/handoff.md` if `task_dir` exists.
12. If the push fully addresses GitHub feedback, mark the addressed feedback as resolved:
    - for review threads, resolve the thread
    - for obsolete bot or workflow comments, hide/minimize the comment with
      classifier `RESOLVED`
13. Never resolve, hide, or minimize feedback that is only partially addressed
    or still needs user judgment.
14. Go back to Phase 5.

Use GitHub GraphQL when needed:

```bash
# Resolve a PR review thread
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { id isResolved }
    }
  }' -F threadId="<thread-id>"

# Hide/minimize an obsolete bot or workflow comment as resolved
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($subjectId: ID!) {
    minimizeComment(input: {subjectId: $subjectId, classifier: RESOLVED}) {
      minimizedComment { isMinimized }
    }
  }' -F subjectId="<comment-node-id>"
```

Output: `[Handoff] Fix round <i>/3 — <what was fixed>. Tests pass. Re-checking CI...`

## Example Workflow

Condensed to show the loop shape. The full log would include the same
verify/commit/push pattern after every fix round.

```
[Handoff] Start — branch feat/auth, base main, 4 files + 2 doc edits
[Handoff] Verify → npm test, npm run lint: PASS
[Handoff] CHANGELOG entry added, README updated
[Handoff] Push, PR created: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123

[Handoff] Wait → ci/test FAILURE
[Handoff] Fix round 1/3 — added nil guard, re-verify PASS, push
[Handoff] Wait → AI review: requested error-path coverage
[Handoff] Fix round 2/3 — added error-path test, re-verify PASS, push
                 resolved review thread, minimized obsolete bot comment

[Handoff] Wait → all checks green
[Handoff] Merge state → CLEAN
[Handoff] DONE — PR #123 green and merge-ready
```

Key invariants the example preserves:
- PR creation is not the finish line — the loop continues until green.
- Local verify runs before every push (first push AND each fix push).
- Fix the smallest real cause from logs, not broad refactoring.
- AI review feedback counts as "action required" — it triggers a fix round.
- Merge readiness is a gate alongside checks; blocked/behind/conflicting
  PRs keep looping.
- Resolve threads / minimize obsolete bot comments only after the fix is pushed.
- Retry limit is 3 fix rounds, then escalate.

## Completion

Done when:

- the PR exists
- relevant GitHub checks are green
- no relevant GitHub checks are pending
- `mergeStateStatus` is merge-ready (`CLEAN`, `HAS_HOOKS`, or `UNSTABLE`
  only when all failing checks are irrelevant/non-blocking)
- `mergeable` is not `CONFLICTING`, and there are no unresolved merge
  conflicts in the local worktree
- the branch is not behind base in a way GitHub/repo policy requires
  updating before merge
- no actionable unresolved review thread or bot/workflow comment remains

Escalate when:

- 3 fix rounds are exhausted
- a remaining issue requires user judgment
- GitHub checks stay pending past the wait timeout
- GitHub state remains ambiguous after one re-query
- merge conflicts or required branch updates cannot be resolved confidently
