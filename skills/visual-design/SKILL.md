# Visual Design

Create production-quality DESIGN.md files following the **awesome-design-md** format — a 9-section markdown standard for describing visual design systems that AI agents (and Google Stitch) can read and faithfully reproduce.

A DESIGN.md is like AGENTS.md for visual identity: drop it in your project root and any AI coding agent generates UI that matches your design language. No Figma exports, no JSON schemas — just markdown.

## Three Modes

Determine which mode applies, then read the corresponding reference file for the full process.

### A. From Scratch

The user describes their vision — mood, colors, fonts, brand references. You explore the vision through structured discovery, propose 2-3 directions, and build the DESIGN.md incrementally with user validation at each stage.

**Read `references/from-scratch.md` for the full process.**

### B. From a Website URL

The user provides a URL and wants the site's design system captured. You clarify scope and intent, inspect the DOM for actual values, validate the extracted foundation with the user, and assemble the DESIGN.md.

**Read `references/from-url.md` for the full process.**

### C. From Current Codebase

The user has an existing project and wants a DESIGN.md extracted from the code. You discover the tech stack, systematically extract tokens, validate with the user, fill gaps, and document what the project actually looks like.

**Read `references/from-codebase.md` for the full process.**

## The 9-Section Format

Every DESIGN.md follows this exact structure. The H1 is always:

```
# Design System Inspiration of [Name]
```

Then 9 numbered H2 sections. See `references/template.md` for the full template with placeholders, and `references/section-guide.md` for detailed writing guidance.

| # | Section | What It Contains |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Visual Theme & Atmosphere | 2-3 paragraphs of design philosophy + Key Characteristics bullet list |
| 2 | Color Palette & Roles | Colors grouped by role (Primary, Accent, Surface, Neutral, Semantic) |
| 3 | Typography Rules | Font families, hierarchy table, typographic principles |
| 4 | Component Stylings | Buttons, cards, inputs, navigation, badges, distinctive components |
| 5 | Layout Principles | Spacing system, grid, whitespace philosophy, border-radius scale |
| 6 | Depth & Elevation | Shadow levels table + shadow philosophy |
| 7 | Do's and Don'ts | 7-10 specific directives each, referencing actual values |
| 8 | Responsive Behavior | Breakpoints, touch targets, collapsing strategy |
| 9 | Agent Prompt Guide | Quick color reference, 5 example prompts, iteration guide |

## Formatting Conventions

These conventions make the file parseable by both humans and AI agents:

- **Hex codes** always in backticks: `` `#533afd` ``
- **RGBA values** in backticks: `` `rgba(50,50,93,0.25)` ``
- **Font names** in backticks: `` `sohne-var` ``
- **CSS values** in backticks: `` `0px 30px 45px -30px` ``
- **Metrics** in backticks: `` `8px` ``, `` `1.40` ``
- **Color names** in bold: **Stripe Purple**, **Deep Navy**
- **Size dual notation**: `56px (3.50rem)` — pixel with rem equivalent
- **Color entry format**: `- **Descriptive Name** (\`#hex\`): Role and usage context.`
- **Component property format**: `- Property: \`value\` (contextual note)`
- Tables use standard markdown pipe syntax
- No YAML frontmatter in the DESIGN.md output (the file is pure markdown)
- No code fences wrapping design content (fences only for inline CSS values)

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting the DESIGN.md, verify:

- [ ] H1 follows `# Design System Inspiration of [Name]`
- [ ] All 9 sections present and numbered
- [ ] Every color has a descriptive name, hex in backticks, and usage description
- [ ] Typography table has all columns: Role, Font, Size, Weight, Line Height, Letter Spacing
- [ ] At least 3 button variants documented (primary, secondary/ghost, tertiary)
- [ ] Shadow table has 4-6 levels with actual CSS values
- [ ] Do's and Don'ts reference specific hex values and measurements
- [ ] Section 9 has 5 concrete example component prompts with real values from the system
- [ ] Breakpoints table covers mobile through large desktop
- [ ] Colors are semantically grouped (not just listed)
- [ ] No orphan values — every color/token referenced in Section 9's Quick Reference appears in Section 2

## Generating Preview HTML

After completing the DESIGN.md, generate a companion `preview.html` — a self-contained HTML file that visually demonstrates the design system.

Read `references/preview-template.html` for the HTML scaffold. The preview should contain:

1. **Navigation bar** — brand name + CTA button in the design system's style
2. **Hero section** — headline and subtitle demonstrating the type scale
3. **Color palette** — swatches for every color in Section 2, labeled with name and hex
4. **Typography scale** — samples at each hierarchy level from Section 3
5. **Button variants** — all button styles from Section 4
6. **Card examples** — 2-3 cards with proper shadows and borders
7. **Form inputs** — default, focus, and error states
8. **Spacing scale** — visual representation of the spacing system
9. **Border radius** — examples at each scale value
10. **Elevation/shadows** — cards at each shadow level

The HTML must be fully self-contained (inline CSS, no external dependencies) and use CSS custom properties for all design tokens. Include a responsive media query so it renders well on mobile too.

If the design system has a dark mode or dark sections, also generate `preview-dark.html` with dark surface backgrounds.

## Completion Gate

Done means `DESIGN.md` contains all 9 sections, `preview.html` is self-contained
and responsive, and any dark-mode claim is backed by `preview-dark.html` or
marked `n/a`. If a required source cannot be inspected, return `BLOCKED` with the
missing source instead of filling gaps from taste.

## Execution Handoff

Output the report card:
